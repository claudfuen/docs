Actions are the building blocks of your workflow. They define what tasks your workflow will perform when triggered.

Think of actions as the "what" of your workflow - they define the specific operations and tasks that will be executed in sequence.

When building a workflow in the Workflows Builder, actions are added after selecting a trigger. The actions you choose will determine what your workflow actually does with the data it receives.

## Adding Actions

To add an action, click the "Add Action" button in the workflow builder and select from the available action types.

## Action Types

### Available Actions

Leap provides a wide range of integrations with popular services through pre-built actions. Here are some examples of what you can do:

#### Communication

- Send messages to Slack channels or users
- Post notifications and updates

#### AI and Machine Learning

- Generate text with Anthropic's Claude
- Create images using Fal.ai's models
- Generate content with OpenAI's GPT models

#### Development Tools

- Add comments to GitHub pull requests
- Interact with repositories and issues

These are just a few examples from our growing library of actions. We continuously add new integrations and capabilities to help you build more powerful workflows.

### Third-Party Service Integration

Leap Workflows integrates with third-party services through two authentication methods:

#### OAuth Authentication

For services like GitHub, Slack, and Google:

1. Click "Connect Account"
2. Log in to the service
3. Authorize Leap's access

OAuth provides secure access without sharing credentials.

#### API Key Authentication

For services requiring API keys:

1. Generate a key from the service's developer portal
2. Add it to the action configuration
3. Leap securely stores and uses the key

#### AI Service Cost Management

When using AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), providing your own API keys offers several benefits:

- Direct billing from AI providers with no markup
- Full control over spending and usage limits
- Usage tracking through provider dashboards
- Support for enterprise agreements and custom pricing

This ensures transparent cost management for AI-powered workflows.

       - Press Delete/Backspace to remove the connection

    2. **Reconnect or move actions:**
       - Click and drag from the teal handle on one action
