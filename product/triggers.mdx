Triggers are the first step in building a workflow. They determine when and how your workflow should run.

Think of triggers as the "when" of your workflow - they define the conditions or events that will cause your workflow to execute.

When building a workflow in the Workflows Builder, selecting a trigger is always the first step. The trigger you choose will determine what data is available to subsequent steps in your workflow and how the workflow can be initiated.

## Creating a Trigger

To create a trigger, click the "Add Trigger" button in the bottom left corner of the Workflows Builder and select the type of trigger you want to create.

## Trigger Types

### Manual / API Triggers

Manual triggers allow you to run workflows on-demand through:

- The Leap Workflows UI dashboard
- Direct API calls using the [Run Workflow](/api-reference/run-workflow) endpoint

This is ideal for:

- Testing and development
- One-off workflow executions
- Integration into your own applications

Manual triggers allow you to configure an optional set of input parameters.

### Schedule Triggers

Schedule triggers let you run workflows automatically at specified intervals using cron expressions. For example:

- Every hour: `0 * * * *`
- Daily at midnight: `0 0 * * *`
- Every Monday at 9am: `0 9 * * 1`

This is perfect for:

- Regular batch processing
- Periodic data updates
- Automated reporting
- Scheduled maintenance tasks

If you're not familiar with cron expressions, you can use the [Cronify](https://cronify.zimo.li/) tool to help. It converts natural language (like "every Monday at 9am") into the correct cron expression format.

### Event-Based Triggers

Event triggers automatically run workflows in response to external events from integrated platforms:

#### Supported Events

- **Slack**
  - New message in channel
- **GitHub**
  - Pull request comments

Event triggers are ideal for:

- Real-time processing
- Automated responses
- Integration with external services
- Building interactive applications

<Info>
  Triggers won't be activated until you publish your workflow. Any changes you
  make to triggers will require republishing the workflow to take effect.
