Loops are a powerful feature in Leap Workflows that allow you to repeat a set of actions multiple times over a list of items. They act as containers for logic that needs to be executed repeatedly.

## Adding a Loop

To add a loop to your workflow:

1. Open the Workflow Editor
2. Click the "Actions" button in the bottom left corner
3. Select "Loop" from the available actions
4. Connect the loop node to other actions using the handle connectors

## Configuring a Loop

Loops require two main configurations:

1. **Actions Inside the Loop**: Add actions that should be repeated using the "Add Action" button within the loop container
2. **Loop Items**: Define what to iterate over using one of these methods:

### Loop Item Sources

#### Manual List

- Create a custom array of items directly in the UI
- Example: List of search queries to process

#### Variable Reference

- Use an array returned by a previous action
- Reference existing workflow data

#### AI-Generated Lists

- **AI Auto**: Automatically try to infer a list of items from the context
- **AI Prompt**: Generate a list while providing a prompt/guidance to the AI

## Loop Settings

### Max Iterations

You can set a maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops or limit processing time. This is useful for:

- Controlling workflow duration
- Managing resource usage
- Preventing unintended long-running processes

## Use Cases

Loops are ideal for:

- Processing multiple items in a dataset
- Performing batch operations
- Running searches with multiple queries
- Executing repeated API calls
- Generating content variations

<Info>
  Actions inside a loop will execute once for each item in your configured list.
  Make sure to properly configure max iterations to avoid unexpected behavior.
