<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Workflow">
    In the Leap dashboard, click on the "Create Workflow" button. You can choose to create a new workflow from scratch or use a template. We recommend starting with a template to get familiar with the platform.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure the Workflow">
  After creating the workflow, you'll be redirected to the editor where you can
  view the workflow, add actions, and configure triggers. Most templates have
  actions and triggers that require connecting an account or setting up API
  keys. Look for any nodes highlighted in red, click on them, and follow the
  configuration steps.

</Step>

<Step title="Publish and Run">
    Once all nodes are configured, click the "Publish" button to save your workflow. If the workflow has a manual trigger, you can click the "Run" button to execute it manually. Otherwise, the workflow will run automatically based on your trigger configuration.

## Learn More

To build effective workflows, it's important to understand the core concepts:

- [Actions](/product/actions) - Learn about the building blocks of workflows and how to configure different types of actions
- [Triggers](/product/triggers) - Understand what triggers are available and how to configure them to automate your workflows

These guides will help you make the most of Leap's workflow capabilities and build more sophisticated automations.

<Tip>
  You can also run workflows from the API, see our [API
  reference](/api-reference/run-workflow) for more details.
