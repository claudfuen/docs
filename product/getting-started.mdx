<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Workflow">
    In the Leap dashboard, click on the "Create Workflow" button. You can choose to create a new workflow from scratch or use a template. We recommend starting with a template to get familiar with the platform.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure the Workflow">
  After creating the workflow, you'll be redirected to the editor where you can
  view the workflow, add actions, and configure triggers. Most templates have
  actions and triggers that require connecting an account or setting up API
  keys. Look for any nodes highlighted in red, click on them, and follow the
  configuration steps.

</Step>

<Step title="Publish and Run">
    Once all nodes are configured, click the "Publish" button to save your workflow. If the workflow has a manual trigger, you can click the "Run" button to execute it manually. Otherwise, the workflow will run automatically based on your trigger configuration.

- [Conditionals](/product/conditionals) - Add if/then logic to make your workflow smarter
- [Loops](/product/loops) - Repeat actions to handle multiple items at once
