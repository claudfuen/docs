Variables are one of the most important concepts in Leap Workflows. They allow you to reference and reuse data throughout your workflow, creating connections between different actions and triggers.

## Understanding Variables

Variables store data that comes from:

- Trigger inputs
- Output from previous actions

Think of variables as containers that hold information which can be passed between different steps of your workflow.

## Using Variables

To use variables in your workflow:

1. Click on an action to open its configuration panel
2. Click on any input field where you want to use a variable
3. Select from the list of available variables in the popup menu

## Variable Rules

When working with variables, keep in mind:

1. **Connection Required**: Steps must be connected in the workflow for their variables to be accessible
2. **Order Matters**: You can only reference variables from steps that come before (upstream) in the workflow
3. **Scope**: Variables are available to all downstream actions after they're created

## Common Use Cases

Variables are commonly used for:

- Passing trigger data to actions
- Using output from one action as input for another
- Storing intermediate results
- Creating dynamic content based on previous steps
- Configuring conditional logic

## Best Practices

To effectively use variables:

- Give your actions descriptive names for easier variable reference
- Test variable connections before publishing workflows
- Use the variable picker UI to ensure correct syntax
- Verify variable data types match expected inputs

<Info>
  The variable picker will only show variables that are valid for the current
  context. If you don't see an expected variable, check your workflow
  connections and step order.
