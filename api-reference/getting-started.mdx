### Get Your API Key

To use the Leap Workflows API, you'll need an API key. You can get one by signing up for a free account at [app.tryleap.ai](https://app.tryleap.ai).

### Running a Workflow via the API

Before you can run a workflow via the API, you'll need to publish it first:

1. Create and test your workflow in the [Leap Workflows Builder](https://app.tryleap.ai/workflows)
2. Click the "Publish" button in the top right corner
3. Your workflow is now ready to be called via the API

After publishing your workflow you'll need to retrieve the `workflow_id` and the `trigger_id` you want to use.

Here's a quick example of how you can publish and retrieve these values:

### API Endpoints

Get started with these key endpoints:

- [Run Workflow](/api-reference/run-workflow) - Execute a published workflow
- [Get Workflow Run](/api-reference/get-workflow-run) - Check the status and results of a workflow run

### Understanding the API Flow

When running a workflow through the API, it follows an asynchronous pattern:

1. First, you call the [Run Workflow](/api-reference/run-workflow) endpoint which immediately returns a workflow run `id`. The workflow execution happens asynchronously in the background.

2. Then, you use the [Get Workflow Run](/api-reference/get-workflow-run) endpoint using the `id` returned from the Run Workflow endpoint to check on the status and retrieve the results. A common pattern is to poll this endpoint every few seconds until the workflow run is complete.

Here's a typical flow:

1. Call `/v2/runs` with your workflow configuration
2. Receive a workflow run `id` immediately
3. Poll `/v2/runs/{workflow_run_id}` periodically to check status and get results
4. Once the status indicates completion, retrieve your workflow output

This asynchronous approach allows you to handle long-running workflows efficiently without keeping connections open for extended periods.
