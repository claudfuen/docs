openapi: get /v2/runs/{workflow_run_id}
---

This endpoint retrieves both the current status and output data of a workflow run. The status indicates whether the workflow is still running, has completed successfully, or encountered an error.

To monitor a workflow's progress, the recommended pattern is to:

1. Call this endpoint periodically (e.g., every 3-5 seconds)
2. Check the status field in the response
3. Once status shows "completed", retrieve the workflow output from the response data
