openapi: get /v2/runs/{workflow_run_id}

This endpoint enables you to retrieve the status of a workflow run, and the output of the workflow.

A common pattern is to run a workflow, and then check on its status and output by polling this endpoint every few seconds until the workflow run is complete.
