openapi: post /v2/runs

This endpoint initiates a workflow run asynchronously. It returns a workflow run `id` immediately and does not wait for completion.

To monitor the workflow's progress and get results, use the [Get Workflow Run](/api-reference/get-workflow-run) endpoint with the returned `id`. A common pattern is to poll this endpoint periodically until the workflow completes.
