## Overview

This example demonstrates how a customer, Thirdweb, uses Leap to automate their weekly changelog updates across multiple marketing channels. The workflow automatically processes their changelog entries from the past 7 days and generates:

- Email newsletters
- Twitter thread drafts
- Blog post summaries

## How It Works

The workflow can be triggered either manually or on a scheduled basis every 7 days. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Content Scraping**: The workflow visits Thirdweb's changelog page and scrapes all recent content
2. **Date Detection**: Using LLMs, it identifies posts from the last 7 days
3. **Content Processing**: For each recent post, it extracts and processes the content
4. **Multi-Channel Distribution**: Automatically generates and distributes content to:
   - Email newsletters with feature summaries
   - Twitter thread drafts highlighting key updates
   - Blog post summaries published via Ghost integration

## Key Benefits

- **Time Savings**: Automates previously manual content distribution tasks
- **Consistency**: Ensures regular communication of product updates
- **Multi-Channel Presence**: Maintains active presence across different platforms
- **Scalability**: Part of a larger automation strategy (one of 30+ workflows)

## Implementation Details

The workflow uses several key Leap features:

- **Scheduling**: Automated runs every 7 days
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts changelog content
- **AI Processing**: LLM-powered content analysis and generation
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Connects with email, Twitter, and Ghost

<Note>
  This workflow can be customized for different content sources, update
  frequencies, and distribution channels based on your specific needs.
